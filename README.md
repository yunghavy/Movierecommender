DATA SCIENCE
Program that lists related films according to ratings given by other users.
Works like IMDB and netflix in recommending users on what to watch



## With the user ID and title of the movie we want recommendations for, and it will return a list of 10 movie titles that are most similar to the input movie based on both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. 
## The function first computes the content similarity scores between the input movie and all other movies based on their overviews, and then uses collaborative filtering to find movies that are similar to the ones the user has rated. 
## It then combines the recommendations from both approaches to create the final list of recommendations.
